# Mapping Education and Safety: Analyzing Chicago Public Schools and Police Beats

This project explores the relationship between Chicagoâ€™s educational landscape and patterns of public safety. By integrating school location and demographic data with police beat boundaries, it provides an interactive map that highlights overlaps, disparities, and community contexts. The goal is to help users visualize connections between education and safety, enabling deeper insights into how geography shapes student experiences across the city.
