st.title('Mapping Education and Safety: Analyzing Chicago Public Schools and Police Beats')
st.text("by Dianne Park (yewonp3)")

st.subheader("Introduction")
st.write("""Understanding how education and safety intersect in urban environments is crucial for addressing the challenges that communities face. In this project, we analyze Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and police beat boundaries to provide insights into the distribution of educational institutions and public safety zones across Chicago. This analysis is especially useful for policymakers, educators, and families who wish to understand the geographical relationships between schools and safety infrastructure.
        Using data from publicly available datasets, including CPS School Locations and Chicago Police Beat Boundaries, we provide interactive visualizations to help users explore the spatial distribution of schools, identify areas with high school densities, and visualize police beat boundaries across the city.
        This tool is designed to be intuitive and informative for anyoneâ€”whether you are a community member seeking insights, a student studying data visualization, or an official looking to make data-driven decisions.""")

            1. Chicago Public Schools Dataset: This dataset includes detailed information about school locations, names, and types (e.g., charter, magnet, or neighborhood schools). Understanding where schools are concentrated can reveal educational opportunities and gaps in specific neighborhoods.
            2. Police Beats Dataset: Police beats are administrative boundaries used for organizing law enforcement operations. Each beat covers a specific region of Chicago, helping allocate police resources effectively.

st.markdown("""
            Education and safety are interdependent pillars of community well-being. Schools rely on safe environments for children to learn and thrive, while police beats provide insights into how safety resources are allocated geographically. By visualizing these datasets together:
            - Policymakers can identify neighborhoods that may need additional resources.
            - Families can explore where schools are located relative to safety zones.
            - Researchers and students can analyze how infrastructure impacts communities.

Each cell is colored using a gradient from light yellow to dark blue, where darker shades indicate higher concentrations of schools. This allows users to quickly identify areas with dense clusters of schools and regions with fewer educational facilities. By highlighting these patterns, the heatmap reveals potential disparities in school access, helping urban planners, policymakers, and families understand where additional resources or infrastructure may be needed.")

By highlighting differences in beat sizes, this visualization helps uncover potential disparities in resource allocation or geographical coverage, as larger beats may require more policing resources to manage effectively.
